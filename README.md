# WebcamSettingsModule
<p> The webcam settings module is a program designed for developers to instantiate different components associated with settings (such as volume level or brightness), in which the components will then be created on-screen for the users to use. This is typically appropriate in circumstances where the general user may lack some interface for changing controls (such as a Raspberry pi project in which there is no peripheral) but have access to a camera. </p>

<h1> Usage </h1>
<h2> General </h2>
<p>The user can navigate through the menu using their index tip as a pointer, as well as through gesture recognition for some parts of the menu.</p>

<ol>
 <li> 
  <h2> Main Menu </h2>
  <p> When the webcam recognition function is activated, the user will be presented with the default menu screen. From here, the users can navigate through the   submenus using the buttons on the top-right, and can adjust particular settings at the bottom.</p> 
 </li>

  <li> 
   <h2> Adjusting Settings </h2>
   <p> The user can then adjust the settings depending upon the particular component. For slider-bars, users can drag or point to the desired value level while in toggle components, users can simply point to the location of the desired value. Once the user is satisfied with the change, they must use a thumbs-up gesture to return to the submenu.
