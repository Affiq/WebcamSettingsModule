# WebcamSettingsModule
 A settings module controlled by hand landmarking and gesture recognition via a webcam

<h1> Usage </h1>
<h2> General </h2>
The webcam settings module is a program designed for developers to instantiate different components associated with settings (such as volume level or brightness), in which the components will then be created on-screen for the users to use. This is typically appropriate in circumstances where the general user may lack some interface for changing controls (such as a Raspberry pi project in which there is no peripheral) but have access to a camera.

The user can navigate through the menu using their index tip as a pointer, as well as through gesture recognition for some parts of the menu.
